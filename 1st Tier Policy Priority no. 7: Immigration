## Mission: (1) Clear and consistent process for those seeking 
    ## temporary asylum, refuge, and/or permanent citizenship.
    ## (2) Enforcement of immigration laws.

## Problem: Confusing policies. Enforcement not following due process.
    ## Children are being separated from their families with no due.
    ## process for re-joining them together. It is grotesque and unacceptable.
    ## Enforcement is not applied equally across people depending on their country of origin.

## ##
## Requirements ##
# Children should not be locked in cages.
# Children should not be seperated from their family.
# Due process should be followed.

### Policy recommendations: Immigration ###
    # Children should not be locked in cages.
    # Children should not be taken from their families.
    # Due process for those standing on American soil. if they were taken
        # off American soil, due process should pick up where it was left off.
    # People should be allowed to seek and apply for temporary asylum, refuge, 
        # and/or permanent citizenship.
    # If non-profits or charities want to support people that are in process
        # or applying for temporary or permanent legal status, they should be
        # allowed to do so.
