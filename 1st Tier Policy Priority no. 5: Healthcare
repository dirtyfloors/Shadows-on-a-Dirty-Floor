## Mission: Establish the Federal policy vision for healthcare.

## Problem: 
    # Insurance is expensive;
    # Medicaid coverage was reduced and removed by Trump administration for 60 million Americans.

## ##
## Requirements: ##
# Make insurance cheaper and less complicated for small businesses owners.
# Medicaid for all. No means tests. You can opt out if its too communisty for you.
# Option to opt-out of insurance coverage. People should be allowed to take risks.
# Reproductive Rights:
    # Women should have time to learn their options and make decisions from moment they are aware they are pregnant.
    # Post birth abortions is not a thing that happens and obviously not a thing we support, 
        # but we have to mention it because the media (Fox News especially) wants 
        # you to think Democrats abort children after they have been birthed. 
        # I've met people that believe it. It's insane, but people believe that.
    # Women should not have to traverse state lines to get care due to local or state laws. 
        # Policy should be at National level.
    # Women should not be considered a criminal for traversing state lines for healthcare or to
        # exercise their reproductive rights.

Policy recommendation: 
# Cheaper insurance options for small business owners and non-workers.
# Option to opt-out of insurance coverage. 
# Medicaid for all. No means tests. You opt out if too communisty for you, you can
    # get your own or go with none at all.
# Reproductive rights: Codify Roe vs Wade.
