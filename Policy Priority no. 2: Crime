## Requirements ##
# People want to feel safe
    #Physical safety
    #cybersecurity
#Equity: People want to feel that they are held accountable to the same laws. Blind justice.
#Due process afforded to all
#Safety requires presence and accountability
#Police Officers must feel safe to be able to provide presence and safety to others
#Perception of safety around police officers (federal, state, local) is important for success.
    #children of all races should feel safe and comfortable around officers of the law. 
    #This is going to take work from families, leaders, and police officers.
#Police officers will feel more safe if they have better skills in martial arts,
    #such as Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and Krav Maga.
    #if police officers feel confident with their skills at close range, they won't
    #have to draw a weapon and use it pre-emptively before they are in close quarters
    #with a suspect or day to day interactions. Basically, non-lethal techniques to
    #de-escalate situations.
