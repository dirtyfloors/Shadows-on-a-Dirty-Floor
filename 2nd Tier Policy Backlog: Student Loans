### Policy Backlog: Student Loans ###

## Problems:
    # student loans can't be discharged in bankruptcy
      # as a result, it's possible for predatory lendors to issue loans for amounts 
      # that aren't feasible to repay with high interest rates.
    # Trump administration rescinded some discharged student loans for fraudulent schools/programs.

## ##
## Requirements ##
## Student loans can be discharched with bankrupty.
## Student loans should have lower interest rates than commercial loans.
## Interest rates or fees typically pay for adminstrative servicing by financial providers. 
## Zero percent interest would be difficult to incentivize servicers and financial providers.
## Student loans that were forgiven and then later rescinded by the Trump administration should be forgiven (again).
## ##

### Policy recommendation: ###
# Student loans can be discharched with bankrupty.
# Forgive student loans that were forgiven under Biden administration, but rescinded by Trump administration.
