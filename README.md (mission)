### Why are we here?

## | Mission: Rebuild the Democratic Party Platform |
## | Collaborate: Identify Policies People Want | 
## | Prioritize: Focus on Highest Value Policy |

### What is the problem?

# Our world is being destroyed by small, insecure, and weak people.
# In a world of destroyers, which is easy, we need creators, planners, and builders. 

### What do we do?
# Propose policies that will improve people's lives and the world around us.

### Who are we?
# Shadows on a Dirty Floor
# We are merely shadows projecting our ideas on the dirty, ground floor of democracy 

### Collaborate: Policies People Want
# We have no power
# We cast our ideas onto the dirty floor
# Collaborate with us to push real policy that people want
# The best ideas come from:
  #a. Listening to ALL viewpoints. 
  #b. Understanding the problem.
  #c. Collaborating on the vision.
  #d. Alignment: The vision must align with stakeholders and our other policies.
  #e. Executing a plan and solution that benefits people.

### Prioritize: Focus on Highest Value Policy
#We prioritize these policies
#We focus on the critical needs with alignment across the party
#Policies must be valuable to the largest groups. We start there. No niche bullshit.

### Rebuild: the Democratic Party
#Ignore the noise. 
#Policies that aren't popular or valuable go away.
#Is your policy purely antithesis of Republican policy? Go away.
#Revenge policy must go away.
#Ignore the noise.
