## Mission: Simplify the tax codes

## Problem: Tax code is complex and hits you from every angle. The wealthy think they
    # pay too much, while the less wealthy think the wealthy doesn't pay enough.

## ##
## Requirements ##
# Taxes should be easier to calculate. Taxes should be simple.
# Taxes should be equitable. People want equitable taxes.
    # This means, I pay 20%, you pay 20%.
    # Less offsets, less exemptions, less arbitrary means tests.
        # I know you policy gurus hate this because of math, feels, and theories.
    # You don't get exempted because you only work part time;
        # and billionaire doesn't get exemption for yaght and plane purchases.
# We pity billionaires because their on paper % of taxes is "higher" than their tax rate, but the actual 
    # amount they pay in taxes is not that. We are giving them *credit* for an assumed dollar figure
    # they are not actually paying. Ask to see the real numbers after all the deductions.
# Transparency with how your taxes are used: 
    #Like Australia, after you file your taxes, you should get an itemized list of how much 
    # of your taxes went to each entity of the federal government. 
## ##

# The bellyaching around taxes is because of the aggregate of all the taxes we pay
# from property tax, to income tax, state tax, sales tax, inheritance, capital gains, all these
# taxes that someone pays feels like so much, but irony is, and I guarantee you, 
# what you pay in total taxes doesn't even cover the cost to pave, repair, and fill the 
# pot holes on the road in front of your house.
    # Next time someone bellyaches about 
# Basically, people are pissed off that single mothers buy cupcake mix with their tax 
# dollars, but your taxes don't even cover the shit you use each day.

### Policy Recommendation: Tax Code ###

# Everyone pays ~15%. No funky exemptions, offsets, or means tests.
# Transparency: Like Australia, after you file your taxes, you should get an itemized list of how much 
    # of your taxes went to each entity of government.
