## Mission: People want to feel safe.

## Problem: Citizens don't feel safe. Tourists and non-citizens don't feel safe. Police don't feel safe.

## Requirements ##
# People want to feel safe
    #Physical Safety
    #Cyber Security
# Equity: People want to feel that they are held accountable to the same laws. Blind justice.
# Due process should be afforded to ALL
# Lower crime rates don't change people's perception of crime in an area quickly.
# Safety requires presence and accountability
# Police Officers must feel safe to be able to provide presence and safety to others
# Perception of safety around police officers (federal, state, local) is important for success.
    # children of all races should feel safe and comfortable around officers of the law. 
    # must cultivate respect for law enforcement
    # This is going to take work from families, leaders, and police officers.
# Police officers will feel more safe if they have better skills in martial arts,
    # such as Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and Krav Maga.
    # if police officers feel confident with their skills at close range, they won't
    # have to draw a weapon and use it pre-emptively before they are in close quarters
    # with a suspect or day to day interactions. Basically, non-lethal techniques to
    # de-escalate situations. 
    # Police Officers have a hard job and they have hearts and bleed blood just like you.
